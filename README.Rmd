`CTUtemplate` is a package to create a template directory structure (and files) and also includes the CTUs annual safety report function.



## Installation

`CTUtemplate` is easiest to install via 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('CTUtemplate', repos = 'https://ctu-bern.r-universe.dev')
```

Linux users might have to install from source:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/CTUtemplate")
```

This may require `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")` if packages were built under a different R version to the one you are using.

## Usage

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CTUtemplate)
```


### Template director structure

Once installed, in RStudio, open a "new project in a new directory" and select "CTU project template". Options in the following window are used to create the folders and headers of R (and STATA) files. 

*Note:* `Directory name` would typically be e.g. `06_Analysis_xx_yy`, and `Create project as a subdirectory of` would be the `21_Statistics_yy` folder of the appropriate project (`yy` should be the same in both cases).

### UNIBE Red

There is also a function for the UNIBEs shade of red:

```{r, fig.height=1, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}
par(mai = c(.5, .1, .1, .1), tck = -.01, mgp = c(1,.2,0))
plot(
  # main point:
  col = unibeRed(alpha = seq(.2, 1, .2)), 
  # other stuff for the figure
  x = seq(.2, 1, .2), y = rep(1,5), 
  pch = 15, cex = 5, xlab = "alpha", ylab = "", 
  yaxt = "n")
```


### Quarto report templates

We now also have some quarto report templates (more still to come, perhaps). At least RStudio v2022.01.1+554 is required for working with them. 

Functions in `CTUtemplate` allow accessing the templates directly from R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# for a generic report
use_qmd_html("folder/report.qmd")
# for a revealjs presentation
use_qmd_pres("folder/presentation.qmd")
```

The above functions will download the templates and other necessary files and (optionally) open the `qmd` file for you. 

See also the [quarto template repo](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/quarto) for more info on our quarto templates. 

See the [quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for loads of info.


### LaTeX Report templates

`CTUtemplate` has an Rmd template for sample size reports and a more generic template
with some examples of how to do things. 

|Function                   |Description
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------
|`use_report_template`      |Opens a generic file with various examples
|`use_ssreport_template`    |Opens a template for a sample size report 
|`use_recreport_template`   |Opens a template for a recruitment report
|`use_param_report_template`|Opens template files for using parameterized reports
|`use_ub_tex_template`      |Opens the UNIBE tex template allowing modifications for additional features of latex

The functions 
are used to open a new template in the location designated (the recommended location
would probably be `08_Reports_projnum`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# for a sample size report
use_ssreport_template("folder/ssreport.Rmd")
# for the examples
use_report_template("folder/report.Rmd")
# for a template recruitment report
use_recreport_template("folder/recreport.Rmd")
# for an example of a parameterized report (note the lack of file extension here)
use_param_report_template("folder/param_report")
```

The top of the header defines the location that the PDF is saved, relative to the Rmd. The `xx` in `08_Reports_xx` should be changed to the project number. `ReportName` on the following line could be changed to something else.

```
knit: (function(inputFile, encoding) { 
      rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                        encoding=encoding, 
                        output_file=file.path(dirname(inputFile), 
                                              '../08_Reports_xx', 
                                              paste0("ReportName_",
                                                     Sys.Date(),
                                                     ".pdf"))) })
```

The templates for sample size calculations and recruitment reports refer to `ProjectName`. This should also be changed to something more meaningful.

If modifications to the latex template are desired, it can be copied to the folder via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_ub_tex_template("folder/report.tex")
```

The YAML header in the Rmd file then needs to be changed to include

```
output: 
  CTUtemplate::report_pdf:
    report_template: "report.tex"
```

Using this approach, other latex packages can be used to extend the capabilities of latex.
