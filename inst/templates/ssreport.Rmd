\chapter{Study objective}

# Primary objective 

Describe study objective. The study objective will usually be defined according to:
* Patients: Which patients are included in the study?
* Interventions: Which are the intervention groups?
* Comparisons: Which are the control groups?
* Outcome: Which is the primary outcome?

# Primary outcome

Description of primary outcome, including:
*	Type of data (binary, ordinal, continuous, count, time-to-event)
*	Time point of assessment
*	In case of continuous outcomes, the measurement scale/units of measurements

# Hypothesis (if applicable)
*	Description of null and alternative hypothesis
*	Testing framework (e.g. superiority)


\chapter{Methods and assumptions}

*	Allocation ratio,
*	Type I and II error rate,
*	Effect measure, e.g. relative risk, difference in means
*	Minimal clinically relevant difference between the groups (or non-inferiority margin),
*	Assumptions about any further parameter that is used, e.g. standard deviation for continuous outcomes, baseline proportion/rate for binary/survival outcomes.
*	Any corrections for dropouts or withdrawals (if applicable),
*	Method or test used for the sample size calculation,
*	Statistics software used (unless standard test/method is used)

```{r, include=FALSE}
# do calculations here...
```


\chapter{Result of sample size calculation}
*	Result, e.g. a table
*	Wording of sample size calculation for the study proposal/protocol
